Question 3

A GET request asks for data to be taken from a source to be displayed on the local machine. A POST request submits data from the local machine to a source. A GET request would be used when a user inputs a URL. The GET request would ask the server for the data and pull it onto the local machine to be displayed in the browser. A POST request might be used for a user to log-in to a website or application with their username and password.

Question 4

A cookie is a piece of information that is stored in a user's web browser, to be accessed at later times by a website or websites that the user visits. A cookie could be used to remember if a user is logged in with a certain account. They relate to HTTP requests because they are a way for the user's machine to communicate with the web site that they are connecting to.
