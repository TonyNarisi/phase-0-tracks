* 200 - OK (The request was successful.)
* 301 - Moved Permanently (The requested resource has permanently moved and all future requests for it should reference the new location.)

* 401 - Unauthorized (User authentication is required to approve request.)
* 403 - Forbidden (The request has been denied, and authorization will not help to approve it.)

3. A GET request is used to request data and files from the server, to be displayed on the user's remote machine. A POST request is used to send data to the server, such as when submitting data from a form. A GET request is used whenever a URL is entered into the browser, or when a user is redirected to another page of the website. A POST request could be used for submitting information, such as a username and password. The POST request is more secure, because a GET request will always be visible in the URL.

4. A cookie is a piece of data that is stored in the user's browser, which is then recalled by the same website or by other websites to customize the user's experience. It could be used to store information about your account's saved activity, or could be used by third-party advertisers to customize their advertisements. Cookies relate to HTTP requests because they are a way for the user's remote machine to communicate back and forth with the server to make the website behave or appear a certain way.
