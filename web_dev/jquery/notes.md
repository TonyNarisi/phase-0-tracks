# How to Learn jQuery

* Read overview of jQuery, such as Wikipedia page
* Find one or two good jQuery cheatsheets online
* Make a HTML and CSS documents to run jQuery tests on
* Test jQuery functions that catch eye one by one on HTML and CSS documents
* Make note of jQuery functions that seem useful in designing future websites in this document, with syntax example given
* Try to think of design elements that websites use and see if jQuery has a function to accomplish that task, or if people have written tutorials on how to use jQuery to accomplish the task

Reflection on Learning Process

As I expected, I feel like I learned the most from experimenting with writing my own jQuery script and using it on a test website. I was able to view what each change in the script did to the site and make sure that I accomplished whatever goal I set to accomplish when beginning to write the function.
