Release 3

Before trying different joins, I added other rows into both the “books” and “authors” tables that did not have matching IDs, in order to demonstrate the differences.

Left Join:
sqlite> SELECT books.name, books.year_published, authors.author_name FROM books LEFT OUTER JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;
The Hobbit|1937|J.R.R. Tolkien
The Fellowship of the Ring|1954|J.R.R. Tolkien
Animal Farm|1945|George Orwell
1984|1949|George Orwell
If on a winter's night a traveler|1979|Italo Calvino
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|1999|J.K. Rowling
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|1998|J.K. Rowling
A Confederacy of Dunces|1980|

Right Join:
sqlite> SELECT books.name, books.year_published, authors.author_name FROM books RIGHT JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;
Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported

Right Join is not currently supported by SQLite3, but if it had worked, I would have expected it to return all of the authors, with any books that they had written.

Full Join:
sqlite> SELECT books.name, books.year_published, authors.author_name FROM books FULL OUTER JOIN authors ON books.author_id = authors.id;
Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported

Full Join is not currently supported by SQLite3, but if it had worked, I would have expected it to return all of the books and all of the authors, including authors without books listed and books without authors listed.
