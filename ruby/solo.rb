# Designing a "Cup" class
# Every cup has three attributes:
#   - size (in mL)
#   - contents
#   - color
# Every cup has three methods:
#   - pour out (removes contents, replacing with "none")
#   - fill up (adds contents to cup with no contents)
#   - ponder life (user looks at cup and wonders if it is half full or half empty)
