# Pseudocode
# Split the full name string into an array to separate first and last names
# Reverse the position of the names
# Join the names back together
# Make all letters in the full name lowercase so that they are easier to smoothly manipulate
# Define string of all vowels and string of all consonants
# Loop through the string, changing all vowels to next vowel and all consonants to next consonant
#   Use previously defined strings to change these
#   Define special conditions for edge cases
# Capitalize the first letter of the first name and of the last name
