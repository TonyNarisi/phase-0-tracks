  <h1>All About Doors</h1>
  <p>If you're on this webpage, I'm assuming you love doors.</p>
  <p>If you don't love doors, <em>what's wrong with you?</em></p>
  <p>Now, I know we all have that one friend who won't stop talking about doors...</p>
  <p><strong>You should be that friend.</strong></p>
  <p>If you're one of the people who visits this site because you need some convincing of why doors are <strong><em>the best</em></strong>, here are a few things we wouldn't have without doors:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Doorknobs</li>
  <li>Knock-knock jokes</li>
  <li>Songs with lyrics that talk about doors</li>
  <li>The way Kramer opens doors in <em>Seinfeld</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I know, you're sitting there thinking, "Obviously, I <em>want</em> a door. I just can't <strong>afford</strong> a door!"</p>
  <p>Well, have I got good news for you! The <a href="http://www.doorclearancecenter.com/">Door Clearance Center</a> has an online store where you can get <strong>great</strong> prices on doors!</p>
  <p>Lastly, I leave you with my top three recommendations for the type of wood you should look for in your door:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Oak</li>
  <li>Cedar</li>
  <li>Composite wood made solely of scraps of recycled doors</li>
  </ol>
