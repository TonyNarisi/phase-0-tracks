<!-- The purpose of HTML semantic tags is to allow for better understanding of the page from behind the scenes. While CSS can organize HTML to make it visually appealing, semantic tags make sense of the HTML to someone is reading the HTML code itself, or to a descriptive reader of a browser screen for someone with a disability.

The browser displays elements on a page in the order they appear in the HTML document.

I learned why typing "html (tab)" gives the HTML document skeleton! I also learned how to create snippets, which I see as being very useful in the future, especially for other "skeletons", such as tables or lists.

Figuring out how to correctly write an HTML snippet was the most difficult part of the challenge for me. I can continue to improve my understanding of this by practicing and writing my own snippets. Snippets can be applied to many languages, so I imagine I can continue to practice this even after moving into CSS, Ruby, Javascript, and other languages. -->
